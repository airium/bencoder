[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/utdemir/bencoder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/utdemir/bencoder)

A simple up-to-date bencode decoder-encoder library on Python.

I wrote this simple implementation because of the lack of bencoding libraries compatible with Python 3.

*Bencode (pronounced like B encode) is the encoding used by the peer-to-peer file sharing system BitTorrent for storing and transmitting loosely structured data.*
